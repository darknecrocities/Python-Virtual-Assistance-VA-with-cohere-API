# Jarvis - Your Voice-Activated Assistant ü§ñüé§

Welcome to **Jarvis** ‚Äì a voice-activated assistant built with Python that listens to your commands and performs a variety of tasks. Whether you're opening websites, playing music, checking the time, or even summarizing content, Jarvis is at your service. üöÄ

## Features üéØ

- **Voice Commands**: Talk to Jarvis and get things done ‚Äì no need for a mouse or keyboard.
- **Web Navigation**: Open websites like Facebook, YouTube, Gmail, and more with just your voice.
- **Music Control**: Play music from YouTube or local files, and even control media.
- **Summarization**: Ask Jarvis to summarize text using AI (Cohere API).

## How It Works üîß

Jarvis listens for specific voice commands and then takes action. Whether you want to open a website or ask for the current time, Jarvis is ready to assist. It uses the following key technologies:

- **Speech Recognition**: Converts your voice into text to understand your commands.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Jarvis responds with clear speech, powered by `pyttsx3`.
- **Cohere API**: Provides intelligent text generation (for summarization and responses).
- **Webbrowser & OS Integration**: Opens apps and websites on your machine based on your voice command.

Customization ‚ú®
Jarvis is fully customizable! You can add new commands, improve the responses, or change the actions Jarvis performs. Just modify the perform_task() function in main.py to add your own commands. You can also tweak the process_with_cohere() function to change how Jarvis interacts with you.

Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è
Speech Recognition Not Working?
Make sure your microphone is properly set up and configured. Try reducing background noise for better accuracy.

Path Issues for Apps?
Jarvis uses absolute paths to open applications (e.g., Discord, Visual Studio Code). Ensure these paths are correct for your system.

API Key Error:
If the Cohere API isn't working, ensure you have a valid API key. Replace the placeholder key in main.py with your own from Cohere.
