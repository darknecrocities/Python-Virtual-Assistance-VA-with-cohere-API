Dependencies 📦
Jarvis uses the following libraries:

Cohere: For text generation and summarization.
pyttsx3: For text-to-speech functionality.
SpeechRecognition: To recognize spoken commands.
pywhatkit: For playing music on YouTube.
sounddevice: For audio recording (optional for advanced features).
webbrowser: To open websites in your default browser.
os: For interacting with the operating system.
To install all dependencies, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Customization ✨
Jarvis is fully customizable! You can add new commands, improve the responses, or change the actions Jarvis performs.

To customize:

Modify the perform_task() function in main.py to add your own commands.
Tweak the process_with_cohere() function to change how Jarvis interacts with you.
Troubleshooting 🛠️
Speech Recognition Not Working?
Make sure your microphone is properly set up and configured. Try reducing background noise for better accuracy.

Path Issues for Apps?
Jarvis uses absolute paths to open applications (e.g., Discord, Visual Studio Code). Ensure these paths are correct for your system.

API Key Error:
If the Cohere API isn't working, ensure you have a valid API key. Replace the placeholder key in main.py with your own from Cohere.
