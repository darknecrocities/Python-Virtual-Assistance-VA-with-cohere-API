## Dependencies üì¶

Jarvis uses the following libraries:

- **Cohere**: For text generation and summarization.
- **pyttsx3**: For text-to-speech functionality.
- **SpeechRecognition**: To recognize spoken commands.
- **pywhatkit**: For playing music on YouTube.
- **sounddevice**: For audio recording (optional for advanced features).
- **webbrowser**: To open websites in your default browser.
- **os**: For interacting with the operating system.

To install all dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Customization ‚ú®

Jarvis is fully customizable! You can add new commands, improve the responses, or change the actions Jarvis performs.

To customize:

- Modify the `perform_task()` function in `main.py` to add your own commands.
- Tweak the `process_with_cohere()` function to change how Jarvis interacts with you.

---

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

- **Speech Recognition Not Working?**  
  Make sure your microphone is properly set up and configured. Try reducing background noise for better accuracy.

- **Path Issues for Apps?**  
  Jarvis uses absolute paths to open applications (e.g., Discord, Visual Studio Code). Ensure these paths are correct for your system.

- **API Key Error:**  
  If the Cohere API isn't working, ensure you have a valid API key. Replace the placeholder key in `main.py` with your own from [Cohere](https://cohere.ai/).
